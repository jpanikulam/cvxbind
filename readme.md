cvxbind
===========

This project is for automatically generating Python bindings for code generated by Jacob Mattingley's [CVXGEN](cvxgen.com).

If you stumble upon this code, and would believe you would find it useful, please shoot me an email. This was designed for personal use, and therefore has many weird quirks.
